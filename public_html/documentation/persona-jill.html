<h3><strong>Name: Jill McIntyre</strong></h3>
    <p><strong>Age: 34</strong></p>
<p><strong>Profession:</strong> Stay-at-home mother to a 4-year-old daughter; Etsy store owner/craft artisan.</p>
<p><strong>Technology:</strong> Jill uses a powerful workstation at home to maintain her Etsy store, and she uses a smart TV as well as an iPhone 11 Pro. As she is home most of the time with her daughter, she connects to high-speed internet service via WiFi.</p>
<p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong> Jill is spiritual, but not religious. She doesn’t go to church very often, but she believes the Bible as she grew up going to church-related events on occasion.  Her daughter claims to have an imaginary friend, ad she hears her talking to them quite frequently.</p>
<p><strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong> Jill has reached out to friends about her daughter’s behavior but gets conflicting advice. One friend says she might need a mental health professional, and another friend tells her it’s probably a spirit that she can see but Jill can’t.  This lack of solid advice is a source of frustration for her. Jill needs answers because her daughter’s behavior seems to be here to stay and she’s worried she won’t “outgrow” it.</p>
<p><strong>Goals:</strong> Jill’s goals by going to paranormalNM.com are to get information about “imaginary friends”.</p>
<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As a user, Jill searches for stories about kids with imaginary friends and reads as much as she can about the subject.  As the site is in a discussion board format, she asks posters further questions about their kids’ imaginary friends and wants to know their opinions.  She also posts her own story in hopes of getting answers.</p>
