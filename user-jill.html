    <h3>Jill's Persona</h3>

        <p><strong>Name: </strong>Jill Parker</p>

        <p><strong>Technology: </strong>iPad, iPhone, networked PC running W10 and MS Office</p>

        <p><strong>Proficiency: </strong>Jill is a bank teller. She requires few IT skills beyond  using the
            bank's accounting app and Microsoft Word. She has average skills using her phone and tablet, which she
            sees as means to an end, not as an end (hobby/business) in themselves. She spends a lot of time texting, and
            about once a week she uses Quicken on her iPad to update her financial records.</p>

        <p><strong>Passion for Technology: </strong> Very little. Jill spends most of her free time reading printed books
            and watching movies on television.</p>

        <p><strong>Attitudes and Needs: </strong> Jill likes reading printed novels and watching movies on TV.
            She is <em>very</em> interested in the paranormal. She watches a variety of ghost hunting shows on weekends.
            She believes in the existence of ghosts. </p>

        <p><strong>Frustrations: </strong> Jill is frustrated trying to raise 10 year old Freddy. He spends too much
        time playing with his imaginary (?) friend, Darryl. Sometime Freddy tells her things that happened on her job, or
        something that is going to happen - and soon does! Freddy says he gets his info from Darryl. Jill wonders
        if Darryl is a ghost. She wishes she could learn more about ghosts and their interactions with children.</p>

        <p><strong>Role: </strong>Topic-focused user</p>
