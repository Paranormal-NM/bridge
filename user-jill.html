<h1>Paranormal-NM</h1>

    <h2>"Jill"</h2>

        <h3>by Duncan Colhoun</h3>

    <h3>Jill's Persona</h3>

        <p><strong>Name: </strong>Jill Parker</p>

        <p><strong>Technology: </strong>iPad, iPhone, networked PC running W10 and MS Office</p>

        <p><strong>Proficiency: </strong>Jill is a bank teller. She requires few IT skills beyond  using the
            bank's accounting app and Microsoft Word. She has average skills using her phone and tablet, which she she
            sees as means to an end, not as an end (hobby/business) in themselves. She spends a lot of time texting, and
            about once a week she uses Quicken on her iPad to update her financial records.</p>

        <p><strong>Passion for Technology: </strong> Very little. Jill spends most of her free time reading printed books
            and watching movies on television.</p>

        <p><strong>Attitudes and Needs: </strong> Jill has most of the same life issues as other 32 year old divorced women.
            She has 2 children, ages 10 and 8. In addition to reading romance novels and watching romantic movies on TV,
            Jill is also <em>very</em> interested in paranormal and horror. She reads anything by Stephen King. She watches
        a variety of horror movies, especially ghost stories on weekends if she doesn't have a date.
        She believes in the existence of ghosts, demons, and mysterious extraterrestrial visitors. </p>

        <p><strong>Frustrations: </strong> Jill is frustrated trying to raise her children while holding down a full-time
          job. She wishes her parents could do more care-giving for her kids, especially 10 year old Freddy. He spends too much
        time playing with his imaginary (?) friend, Darryl. Sometime Freddy tells her things that happened on her job, or
        something that is going to happen - and soon does! Freddy says it's OK, he gets his info from Darryl. Jill wonders
        if Darryl is a ghost, or demon. When Freddy talks about Darryl and their playtime, Jill always thinks about the
            character of Carol Ann from <em>Poltergeist</em>. She wishes she could learn more about ghosts and
            their interactions with children.</p>
